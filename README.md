Hi, I'm Connor ðŸ‘‹
This is where I'm going to store everything I work on, my generally useful modules, and any examples of cool or useful concepts I consider worth noting.
My goal here is to keep my code easily accesible for future reference, and as efficient as possible to test my own understanding.
